        <h1>HTML and CSS</h1>

        <h2>HTML and CSS have a virtually inseparable relationship with one another to the
            extent that in order to learn web development you must understand both languages
        </h2>
        <h3>HTML defines the structure</h3>
        <h3>CSS defines the styling</h3>
        <h2>The supposed "unstyled page" doesn't really exist</h2>
        <h3>Default browser styles</h3>
        <h3>Custon authored styles</h3>
        <h2>Types of styles</h2>
        <h3>Inline style - adding markup to invidual HTML elements</h3>
        <h3>Internal style sheets - sequential markup added to the (style) element in the HTML document</h3>
        <h3>External style sheets - linking HTML documents to a .css file that contains your styles</h3>
        <h3>Style differently based on whether an HTML document is being viewed on a desktop
            or a mobile device
        </h3>
        
        <h2>Each style sheet is made up of style rules containing two part</h2>
        <h3>Selector</h3>
        <h3>Declaration:</h3>
        <h4>Property</h4>
        <h4>Value</h4>
        <img src="images/selector.gif" alt="style rule">
        
        <h2>Declarations can configure a single or multiple values</h2>
        <h3>H1 {color:teal;}</h3>
        <h3>H1 {font-family:Arial;}</h3>
        <h3>H1 {color:teal; font-family: Arial;}</h3>
        <h2>Whitespace is irrelevant but each designer wil have their own preference as 
            to how they write CSS style rules
        </h2>
        <h2>Style sheets override the browsers default styling and your style declarations 
            will alter the final appearance of the web page in the browser
        </h2>
        <h3>Keep in mind that users can override your styles!</h3>

        <h1>Creating Inline Styles</h1>

        <h2>Inline styles use the style attribute are applied usally to a single element
            within a page
        </h2>
        <h3>Essentially passing CSS within the HTML element</h3>
        <h3>Not very efficient</h3>
        <h3>Sometimes they are useful such as with HTML based email</h3>

        <h1>Controlling Typography</h1>

        <h2>In order to control fonts you need to understand various properties available
            in CSS as well as cretain considerations
        </h2>
        <h3>Font Families</h3>
        <h3>Font styles</h3>
        <h3>Font weight</h3>
        <h3>Font size</h3>
        <h4>Px or em or %</h4>

        <h2>Font Families</h2>
        <h3>Generic family - groups with a similar look like "Serif" or "Monospace"</h3>
        <h4>Serif fonts have small lines at the ends on some characters</h4>
        <h4>Sans-serif fonts do not have those lines</h4>
        <h4>Monospace fonts have characters all with the same width</h4>
        <h3>Font family - a specific font family like "Times New Roman" or "Arial"</h3>

        <h2>While its not required some additional information about the CSS Box Model
            can be very helpful when dealing with typography
        </h2>
        <h2>The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element:</h2>
        <img style="margin-left: 4em;" src="images/Box Model.gif" alt="Box Model" title="Box Model">
