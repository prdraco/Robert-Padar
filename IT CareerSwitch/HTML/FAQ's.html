    <h1>FAQ page</h1>
    <p>Above all, your FAQ page should be straightforward and super-easy for customers to use. 
    These tips will help make sure your page follows FAQ best practices:</p>

    <p>Use “FAQ” or “Frequently Asked Questions” as the page title
    Write questions from the point of view of your customer
    Write the FAQ sheet in an actual question-and-answer format
    Keep answers short
    Fully answer the question, don’t just link to a different page
    Start your answers to yes/no questions with a “yes” or a “no”
    Avoid jargon—write like your customers talk</p>
    
    <h3>Show some personality in your answers</h3>

    <p>1. Call the page an FAQ: People know what an FAQ is already, so make that your page title. 
    Don’t overcomplicate things by calling it “Good to Know” or “More Info”. Sometimes people 
    put the frequently asked questions section on their Contact page, but you can create your 
    own page and put it right in your website navigation menu or website footer so it’s easy to find.</p>

    <p>2. Write questions in the first person—from the point of view of the customer: Write the 
    question as the reader would ask it. So the customer is “I” and you, the website owner, 
    are “you”. Sticking to this format makes more sense for a reader, reduces confusion, and 
    more closely matches what people actually type into search engines:</p>

    Write from the point of view of a customer:<br>

    “Can I purchase a gift certificate?” <br>

    instead of<br>

    “Can you purchase a gift certificate?” or “Can customers purchase gift certificates?”<br>

    <p>3. Use a question-and-answer format: This sounds obvious…but don’t forget to write actual 
    questions with answers. No one likes to be tricked into clicking on an FAQ when they’re 
    actually getting your About Page or a marketing pitch.</p>

    <p>4. Keep answers short: Sometimes getting a straight, quick answer to your question is a relief. 
    So keep answers to a short paragraph if you can, less than 100 words. If you’re giving a sales 
    pitch or diving into an incredible amount of detail, it doesn’t belong on the FAQ page.</p>

    <p>5. Actually answer the question: You’d be surprised how many FAQs avoid giving a straight 
    answer or they send you on a wild goose chase to another page entirely. When possible, answer 
    the entire question in the FAQ without linking away to another page. You can provide links 
    to more info, but the answer itself should be right there on the page.</p>

    For example – which one is more useful?<br>

    Q: What is your return policy?<br>

    A: We allow returns of all items within 30 days of your order date. Just send us an email 
    with your order number and we will send you a return label.<br>

    or,<br>

    A: Our return policy is available here (link).<br>

    <p>6. Start your answer to yes/no questions with a “yes” or a “no”: Those simple words can save 
    people time. Also, having definitive answers to questions (yes/no) sounds more confident and 
    legitimate than a wishy washy, “well, sometimes, perhaps, maybe….”</p>

    For example – which one is clearer and more convincing?<br>

    Q: Do you test on animals?<br>

    A: No. We never test on animals. Here’s our certification (link) ←clear, decisive answer.<br>

    or, <br>

    <p>A: Animal testing is an issue that we have considered deeply in our mission statement and 
    business practices. We are part of the Leaping Bunny Certification programme, the gold 
    standard for cruelty-free certification… ← boring, not a clear answer.</p>

    <p>7. Steer clear of jargon: One reason that FAQs work well is because they match what users 
    are already thinking or asking. To that end, make sure that you’re using the vocabulary 
    and phrases that your customers already know.</p>

    Example: Using normal language
